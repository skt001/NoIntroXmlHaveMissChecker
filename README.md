# No-Intro XML Have/Miss Checker

The No-Intro XML Have/Miss Checker is a tool designed to compare your game collection against a No-Intro XML DAT file. It helps you identify which games you have and which ones you are missing from your collection, based on the information provided in the XML file.

## Key Features

- Compare your game collection against a No-Intro XML DAT file
- Identify "Have" and "Miss" games in your collection
- Recursive folder scanning to include games in subfolders
- Supports both regular files and ZIP archives
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation and comparison
- Detailed game information display, including name, description, file name, size, CRC, MD5, and SHA1
- Quick search functionality for missing games using the built-in search buttons

## Important Note

Please note that this tool does **not** perform any CRC, MD5, or SHA1 checks on your game files. It relies solely on the file names to determine the "Have" and "Miss" status of your games. The CRC, MD5, and SHA1 information displayed is purely informational and is not used for comparison purposes.

The primary goal of this tool is to provide a quick and easy way to compare your game collection against a No-Intro XML DAT file based on file names alone. It is designed to give you an overview of your collection's completeness without the need for extensive file integrity checks.
